# How to use the scouting site


This README file will give you a rough understanding as to how the site works and how to use it to gather data.

There are 2 pages in the scouting site that are used for gathering and reading data.

## https://test2220.github.io/scout/scouter


This page is used for collecting data from matches. After each match, finalize the data from that match and press the 'Submit' button at the bottom of the page.

A QR code will be generated and can be scanned by a scouting coordinator using their device.

## https://test2220.github.io/scout/coordinator


This page is used to scan QR codes that are created on the scout-client page.

The guide linked below helped us create both the scout-client and the scout-reader pages when working with QR codes.
